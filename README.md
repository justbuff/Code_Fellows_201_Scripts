# About this Repo

This repo is a collection of all the Ops Challenges I completed during the Code Fellows Ops and Cybersecurity 201 course. The Ops Challenges contain code (usually in the form of scripts) that I wrote to solve specific objectives given for each day. I am learning these scripting skills to both increase my coding skill and to bolster my cybersecurity abilities. I've learned about scripting in Bash, PowerShell and  batch files. I have also learned to code functions, loops, variables, parameters, arrays, and more. 

My favorite Ops Challenge was Challenge 09, as I felt confident in my PowerShell scripting and was able to locate and use some new commands like Format-Table. Many of these shell scripts can be applied to the workplace to help automate varied tasks and print useful computer system information. I would like to continue to improve my PowerShell scripts, particularly Challenge 12 dealing with creating files and populating them. I'm looking forward to improving my PowerShell and Bash scripting in the future and getting more comfortable with new commands while applying them to those I've already learned.
